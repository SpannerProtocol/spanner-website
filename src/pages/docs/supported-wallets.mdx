## Wallets

While waiting wallet support for Polkadot/Subtrate matures, Spanner has created a custodial wallet service to improve the experience of users on Spanner.
Spanner will actively add additional wallet options as they become available. 

### Custodial Wallets

Users can use any Ethereum wallet that is available via [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/wallets) to authenticate with Spanner.
When a user uses their Ethereum wallet, a keypair is generated for them by Spanner using Hierarchical Determinstic (HD) Key Derivation and 
is not stored. If user wants to use other wallet options in the future to have control over their own keys, they can do so and transfer their balances over.

### Universal Signer Wallets via Desktop Browser Extensions

We currently support desktop universal signers such as PolkadotJS and MathWallet. 
This is for users with experience with crypto wallets and wants control over their own keys.
Using the wallet you can create your own account with the following information:

-   _Network_: Polkadot Substrate
-   _Key Derivation and Signing Algorithm_: Schnorrkel/Ristretto x25519 (sr25519)
