## DPO Statuses and Actions

### CREATED

A DPO is created by a **Manager** and has a **Target** objective and expiry (e.g. crowdfund 1000 BOLTs before block #10000). It has 100 equal-value seats for purchase to earn yields. A target can be to (1) buy an incentive package such as TravelCabin in BulletTrain or (2) chain to another DPO by buying its seats. On creation, the Manager specifies a **Default Target** which helps determine the DPO's crowdfunding amount.
<br /><br />
A Member can be a **User Member**, or a **DPO Member** (DPO buys seats of another DPO).

-   A Manager can buy 0 to 15 seats
-   A User Member can buy 1 to 15 seats
-   A DPO Member can buy 1 to 30 seats

A DPO has 4 token accounts: 

-   **Deposit Account** to store funds raised from seats.
-   **Yield Account** to store yield and milestone rewards.
-   **Bonus Account** to store bonus rewards.
-   **Withdraw Account** to store the funds to be withdrawn by seat buyers.

Funds in the latter three accounts can be released by anyone to their rightful owners. 

### ACTIVE

If seats are sold out before expiry, the DPO becomes ACTIVE and is ready to purchase a target. If the _Default Target_ is still available, the DPO must buy it. Otherwise, it is free to buy another target. After buying a target, any unused funds will immediately be returned to its Members in proportion to seat. 

### FAILED

If a DPO does not become ACTIVE before expiry, then it has FAILED. All funds in the _Deposit Account_ will go to its _Withdraw Account_. No other actions are allowed except for withdrawing from this DPO. If the member is a DPO, the withdrawn amount will go to its deposit account, which can be used to buy another Target.

### RUNNING

If a DPO has started receiving rewards.

### COMPLETED

An ACTIVE DPO becomes COMPLETED upon a successful release of funds from the _Withdraw Account_. This can only occur for two cases:

1.  The purchased Target is an incentive package (e.g. a TravelCabin), and it has matured. The funds will first be withdrawn from the package to the DPO's _Withdraw Account_. Once the funds are released to its members, the DPO becomes COMPLETED.
2.  The purchased Target is DPO, and is COMPLETED. This signals the DPO's funds have been returned to its _Withdraw Account_. The DPO will also become COMPLETED once funds are released to its members.

## DPO Incentives

### Management Fee and Yields

The Management Fee is applied to each Yield release and is determined by these rules:

-   **Skin In the Game**: The fee is set as (5 + Z)%, where Z is the number of seats bought by the DPO Manager on creation. This fee will stay the same even if a manager decides to buy additional seats at a later time.
-   **Lifetime Sentence**: Once ACTIVE, the Manager has 7-days to purchase a target. After this period, any Member can act on behalf of the DPO and the Management Fee will be permanently slashed in half (to punish the lazy manager).
    <br /><br />
    Note: a DPO Member will act through its Manager.

Releasing Yields empties the _Yield Account_ and distributes the yield by these rules:

-   **Lazy Slashing**: Management Fee for this release will be slashed in half if (1) the yield account has been accumulating for more than 5 days, and (2) the yield is not released by the manager.
-   **Fair Reward**: Yields after fee are distributed to the Manager and all Members in proportion to seat.

### Referral and Bonuses

Any user can refer any DPO to others. A user can have no referrer or a permanent referrer by token project (e.g. Alice and Bob can be the referrer for Charlie for project BOLT and project NCAT, respectively.
<br /><br />
All Members of a DPO must have an **Internal Referrer**. If they were not referred by an existing Member (they have no referrer or was referred by a Non-Member, i.e. **External Referrer**), they will be assigned an Internal Referrer from the **Earlybird Queue**.
<br /><br />
The _Earlybird Queue_ works by **First Come, First Served**:

-   A newly joined _User Member_ (not DPO Member) will be placed in the _Earlybird Queue_.
-   If the queue was priorly empty, the Manager will be assigned as the new Member's _Internal Referrer_.
-   Otherwise, the first Member in the queue will be assigned as _Internal Referrer_ and then removed from the Queue.

| :------------------------------: |
| How to form a referral structure |

We devised a **Referral Point** system, named Emit-Catch-Divide to record and reward contributions of all referrers of a DPO (both Internal and External).
<br /><br />

```math





Property 1:

  Value in project's token for each Referral Point 
      = (Package Bonus / Package Price) * 
        (DPO's used amount / DPO's total raised amount)
        
  Also known as Bonus Rate (as shown in the image below)





```

For example, if a DPO raised 2000 BOLTs and purchased a package costing 1000 BOLTs() giving 60 BOLTs Bonus), 
then each Referral Point of that DPO will be worth (60 / 1000) _ (1000 / 2000) = 0.03 BOLT.
<br /><br />
If a User Member's total value of seats is 300, it will emit 300 _ 0.03 = 9 BOLTs to its referrers.

How do we enforce a global property while all DPOs of a DPO Chain are settled locally? This is mathematically guaranteed by Emit-Catch-Divide.

#### Emit

The Emit rule enables Referral Points to be settled at each individual DPO. 
Upon buying DPO seat(s) with a total value of X, X Referral Points of the DPO will be given to the buyer, 
except if it is a manager of a non Lead DPO. A Lead DPO is the DPO which buys a TravelCabin instead of seats of another DPO.

The buyer will emit respective amounts to referrers according to its role in the DPO:

-   Manager of this DPO =&gt; emit nothing
-   User Member =&gt; emit X
-   DPO Member =&gt; emit X \* (it's manager's number of seats / 100)

#### Catch

The emitted _Referral Points_ will then be caught by referrers as follows:

-   if the Member has an _External Referrer_, its External Referrer will catch 30%.
-   the remaining will be caught as follows:
    -   if the _Internal Referrer_ is the _Manager_, the _Manager_ will catch 100%
    -   if the _Internal Referrer_ is a _Member_, the _Internal Referrer_ will catch 80%, and the _Internal Referrer_'s _Internal Referrer_ will catch the remaining 20%

#### Divide

Bonus Rewards received by the DPO will be divided proportionally according to the Referral Points each referrer related to the DPO holds.
