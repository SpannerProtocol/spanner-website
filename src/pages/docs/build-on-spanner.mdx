# Build Projects on Spanner

Quickly build high-quality crypto projects on Spanner. As Spanner's catalogue of components grow, 
they will be made accessible to projects through our one-click-deployment marketplace. 

## Getting Started

Projects can quickly create their token and then add it to Spanner DEX Liquidity Pools in minutes.
This can be done without code and will be made available via our web application. 

## Open collaboration

After Mainnet launch, open-source developers will be able to collaborate with us on creating components 
to solve problems for their own business verticals. The more projects, the more components. 
Since inception, we envisioned having a component for every challenge and this mission will require help from our open-source community.
We believe that Spanner's success is intricately bound to the success of its projects.
