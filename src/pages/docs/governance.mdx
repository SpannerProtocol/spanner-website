### Validators

During our Substrate R&D, we evaluated the requirements of implementing Spanner as a Polkadot Parachain.
From our research, we decided to opt out of using nPoS validator mode to ease our transition to become a Polkadot Parachain. 
Our priority is to become a Parachain and have Spanner secured by Polkadot rather than deploying significant efforts towards nPoS development 
which will hinder our progress towards this goal.

### Governance Transition

Spanner intends to be fully decentralized and community governed once we start becoming a Polkadot Parachain candidate. 
Spanner's governance features are the same as Polkadot and are already fully implemented but is temporarily disabled during our launch.
Similar to [Polkadot's governance transition](https://polkadot.network/launch-governance/), the team will enable governance modules on Spanner and remove Sudo 
when Spanner becomes a Parachain.
