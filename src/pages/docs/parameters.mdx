# Parameters

Many of these parameter values can be updated via on-chain governance. If you require absolute
certainty as to their values, it is recommended you directly check the constants on the explorer.

## Periods of common actions and attributes

-   Slot: 6 seconds \*(generally one block per slot, although see note below)
-   Epoch: 4 hours (2,400 slots x 6 seconds)
-   Session: 4 hours (Session and Epoch lengths are the same)
-   Era: 24 hours (6 sessions per Era, 2,400 slots x 6 epochs x 6 seconds)

| Spanner | Time      | Slots\* |
| ------- | --------- | ------- |
| Slot    | 6 seconds | 1       |
| Epoch   | 4 hours   | 2,400   |
| Session | 4 hours   | 2,400   |
| Era     | 24 hours  | 14,400  |

\*_A maximum of one block per slot can be in a canonical chain. However, occasionally a slot will be
without a block in the chain. Thus, the times given are estimates.
